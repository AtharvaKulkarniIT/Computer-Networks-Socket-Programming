## How to Use This Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the relevant examples. Each code snippet is accompanied by detailed comments to guide you through the implementation. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these examples aim to enhance your understanding of socket programming in C.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have `gcc` installed on your Ubuntu system. If not, you can install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install gcc
  ```

### Compile and Run Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtharvaKulkarniIT/Computer-Networks-Socket-Programming.git
   cd Computer-Networks-Socket-Programming
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Example:**
   ```bash
   cd example-directory
   ```

3. **Compile the C Program:**
   - Use `gcc` to compile the C program. For example:
     ```bash
     gcc your_program.c -o your_program
     ```
     This command compiles `your_program.c` and creates an executable named `your_program`.

4. **Run the Executable:**
   - Run the compiled program using `./your_program`. For example:
     ```bash
     ./your_program
     ```
